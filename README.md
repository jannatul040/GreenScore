## 📌 About the Project

**GreenScore** is a full-stack sustainability platform built with PHP and MySQL. Organisations complete a structured environmental assessment across **10 categories**, earn one of **14 progressive badge levels**, and receive official downloadable **certificates** — Gold, Silver, Bronze, or Participation — based on their cumulative performance.

The platform includes a community tip board, a user feedback system, a secure contribution flow for upgrading certificates, a comprehensive admin dashboard, dark mode, and a full toast notification system — all built with a strong emphasis on security best practices.

> 🎓 Developed as part of the **Graded Unit 2 Software Development** assessment at **Edinburgh College** — Academic Year 2024/2025.

## 🛡️ Security

Security was a core design priority throughout development:

| Protection | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Password hashing | `password_hash()` with bcrypt — auto-salted, unique per user |
| SQL injection | Prepared statements with bound parameters across all 44 PHP files |
| CSRF protection | Token generated once per session in `init.php`, validated on every state-changing form |
| Session fixation | `session_regenerate_id(true)` immediately on login; periodic regeneration every 15 min |
| Idle timeout | Session destroyed after 30 minutes of inactivity |
| Login rate limiting | IP blocked after 5 failed attempts in 15 minutes — recorded in `login_attempts` table |
| Password complexity | Min 8 chars, uppercase + lowercase + number required, common passwords blocked |
| Cookie flags | `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` on session cookie |
| Security headers | `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Permissions-Policy` |
| Role-based access | Admin routes return HTTP 403 if accessed without correct session role |
| Output sanitisation | All user data escaped with `htmlspecialchars()` before rendering |
| `.htaccess` | Blocks direct GET to `includes/`, blocks `.sql/.env/.log` files, custom 403/404 pages |

## Database

Six tables with foreign key constraints and cascading deletes:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `new_users` | Accounts, roles (`admin`/`user`), statuses, company details |
| `green_calculator_results` | Scores, award levels, badge data, donation records |
| `community_tips` | User-submitted tips with ownership |
| `feedback` | Messages, admin responses, public visibility flag |
| `credit_cards` | Saved card details per user |
| `login_attempts` | IP-based rate limiting records |

The full schema with seed data is available at [`database/gradedunit.sql`](database/gradedunit.sql).

## Testing

**42 tests — 63 assertions — all passing**

| Test Class | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `LoginTest` | `password_verify()` path, correct session keys, wrong password, unknown email, admin role |
| `GreenCalculatorTest` | All 4 award thresholds by boundary value, all-green/amber/red scoring, shortfall and cost |
| `CommunityTipsTest` | Message validation, trimming, HTML escaping, auth guard, ownership check, pagination |
| `PaymentTest` | Cost from shortfall, clamping (min/max), formatting, float conversion, post-payment state |

A `fake_login_tools.php` helper simulates authenticated session state for testing protected routes without a live database connection.

```bash
php phpunit.phar --testdox --colors=never
```
